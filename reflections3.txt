When would I want to create remote repository rather than keeping all files locally.
  it's useful when working on a big projects
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having GitHub automatically stay up-to-date with you remote repository?
	Because there could be some changes I've done, and they may conflict with some changes someone else has done.

3.Describe differencies between fork, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	- forks are useful when downloading someone else's work (repository) and working with them without affecting original repository (files). I could also contribute to the original repository if my work is accepted.
	- clones are used when just coping other people's work (repo) to my local machine. 
	- branches - use them when taking other direction (experimental) without affecting master branch.
