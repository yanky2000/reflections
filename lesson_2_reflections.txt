lesson2.
1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    git created a .git directory and it's ready now to track changes.
2. about staging ares. It helps organizing commits, before actually making them.
3. How having a staging area helps ensure that i have only one commit per logical change. I can remove unwanted file from staging area and not commiting it. thus, addit it to the next commit. 
4. How would branches help? - What are situation when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? When I want to experiment a diffrernt direction in coding (let's say a diffrernt approach), but want to perserve the orginal version of files. Adding a branch would help to work on 2, without affecting each other. 
5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure? It's a lot easier to see what commits would be unreachable and when to start a new branch
6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why showing it in a map? Map helps to track which commits may be missed if merge branches. It helps to track when actually to merge commits.
